# Tomato Soup Recipe

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 50g parmesan cheese (optional)
- 2 cups (about 500g) fresh tomatoes, chopped (or 1 can (28 oz) whole peeled tomatoes)
- 2 cups (500ml) vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional, for richer flavor)
- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil or oregano (optional)
- 1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream or milk (optional, for creaminess)
- Fresh basil or croutons for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Saut√© Aromatics:**
   - Heat olive oil or butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped
     onion and cook until soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Stir in the
     minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

2. **Cook the Tomatoes:**
   - Add the fresh or canned tomatoes (with juices) to the pot. Stir in the
     tomato paste if using. Season with salt, pepper, and optional herbs. Cook
     for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down.

3. **Add Broth and Simmer:**
   - Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce
     the heat and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes. If the soup tastes too acidic,
     stir in a teaspoon of sugar.

4. **Blend the Soup:**
   - Remove the pot from heat. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth,
     or carefully transfer it to a blender in batches.

5. **Add Cream (Optional):**
   - If you want a creamy soup, stir in the heavy cream or milk and heat gently for 2-3 minutes. You can also add parmesan cheese.
     Do not let it boil.

6. **Serve:**
   - Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh basil
     or croutons. Enjoy!
